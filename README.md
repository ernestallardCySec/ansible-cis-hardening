## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **What this Ansible playbook does**  
  - Applies Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark controls for RHEL 9.
  - Hardens SSH, firewalld, SELinux, and more via Ansible tasks.
  - Reports each task as **`ok`** (already compliant) or **`changed`** (remediation applied).

- **Why it matters**  
  - Shrinks attack surface by enforcing best practices.
  - Saves time over manual configuration or brittle shell scripts.
  - Provides instant visibility into your security posture.
